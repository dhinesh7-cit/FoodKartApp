# FoodKartApp
FoodKart is a simple, console-based food delivery application inspired by platforms like Swiggy and UberEats. This project allows users to register as customers or restaurant owners, place food orders, and give ratings to restaurants. It operates without a database or UI, storing everything in memory.
